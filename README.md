# DemoAngular

This project was created using [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 14.1.1.

## Development Server

To start the development server, run `ng serve`, then navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically refresh if you make changes to the source files.

## Code Scaffolding

You can create a new component by running `ng generate component component-name`. Additionally, you can generate directives, pipes, services, classes, guards, interfaces, enums, or modules using similar commands.

## Build Process

Execute `ng build` to compile the project. The output will be saved in the `dist/` folder.

## Running Unit Tests

To run unit tests, use `ng test`, which will execute tests with [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running End-to-End Tests

For end-to-end testing, run `ng e2e`. Ensure that you have the necessary package for end-to-end testing capabilities installed beforehand.

## Additional Support

For more assistance with Angular CLI, use `ng help` or refer to the [Angular CLI Overview and Command Reference](https://angular.io/cli) page.
